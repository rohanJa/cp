find DIR_NAME -type f | wc -l

Explanation:

    =>  -type f to include only files.
    =>  | (and not Â¦) redirects find command's standard output to wc command's standard input.
    =>  wc (short for word count) counts newlines, words and bytes on its input (docs).
    =>  -l to count just newlines.
